Nanoservices framework

It is in development by now, a more meaningful readme will be added later

------------

You'll need: `cmake` (minimum version is 3.19), `make` and a C++20 compiler (the framework is tested with gcc 10.3.0)

```bash
git clone git@github.com:dmerkushov/nanoservices2.git`
cd nanoservices/
mkdir build
cd build/
cmake ..
cmake --build .
cd ../..
```
